A proper bankroll for micro stakes cash games is 20-30 buy-ins, which means $40-60 for 1c/2c games with a $2 buy-in. Many sites also offer free-to-play tables and freeroll tournaments."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should beginners play cash games or tournaments?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cash games are generally better for beginners because the blinds stay constant, you can buy in for any amount within the table limits, and you can leave anytime. Tournaments require understanding of changing blind structures and ICM theory. Start with cash games to build fundamentals, then try tournaments once you are comfortable."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does it take to get good at poker?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Most dedicated players can beat micro stakes games within 3-6 months of serious study and practice.

  <h1>Online Poker Strategy for Beginners 2026: Complete Guide</h1>

  <p>Online poker can feel overwhelming when you are starting out. You sit down at a virtual table, get dealt two cards, and suddenly need to make decisions involving math, psychology, and risk management, all in about 15 seconds. The good news is that beating the lowest stakes of online poker does not require genius-level intellect or years of study. It requires understanding a handful of fundamental concepts and applying them consistently.</p>

  <p>This guide is written specifically for people who know the basic rules of Texas Hold'em but have not yet developed a winning strategy. If you understand that a flush beats a straight and that the button moves clockwise, you have enough knowledge to start here. By the end of this guide, you will understand the core strategic concepts that separate profitable players from everyone else at the micro stakes.</p>

  <p>The concepts in this guide are focused on No-Limit Texas Hold'em cash games, which is the most popular format online in 2026. Most principles also apply to tournaments, though tournament-specific strategy is a topic for another guide.</p>

  <h2 id="mindset">The Winning Mindset</h2>

  <p>Before we talk about cards and strategy, you need to understand what winning at poker actually means. Winning at poker does not mean winning every hand, every session, or even every week. Winning at poker means making decisions that have a positive expected value over thousands of hands. You will lose individual hands to bad luck. You will have losing sessions. You will sometimes make the perfect play and still lose. That is the nature of the game.</p>

  <p>The players who succeed long term are the ones who can separate the quality of their decisions from the outcome of individual hands. If you get your money in as an 80% favorite and lose, you made a great decision. The result was unlucky. If you do that 100 times, you will win approximately 80 of them. Focus on making the best decision available, and the results will follow over time.</p>

  <blockquote>Poker is a game of decisions, not outcomes. Judge yourself by the quality of your choices, not by whether you won or lost this particular hand.</blockquote>

  <h2 id="starting-hands">Starting Hand Selection</h2>

  <p>The single fastest way to improve as a beginner is to play fewer hands. Most losing players at the micro stakes play far too many hands. They see a king with a weak kicker and think "I have a king!" They see suited cards and think "I might hit a flush!" They call with mediocre holdings and then find themselves in difficult spots after the flop with a marginal hand.</p>

  <h3>Hands You Should Always Play</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Premium pairs:</strong> AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT. These are your bread and butter. Raise preflop every time from any position.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong aces:</strong> AK, AQ (suited or unsuited). Raise preflop from any position.</li>
  <li><strong>Medium pairs:</strong> 99, 88, 77. Raise from middle and late position. Call a raise from early position if the price is right.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hands You Should Play in Late Position</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Suited connectors:</strong> JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s. These hands make straights and flushes and play well in position.</li>
  <li><strong>Suited aces:</strong> A5s, A4s, A3s, A2s. Nut flush potential makes these profitable in late position.</li>
  <li><strong>Broadway hands:</strong> KQo, KJs, QJs. Strong enough to play from the cutoff and button.</li>
  <li><strong>Small pairs:</strong> 66, 55, 44, 33, 22. Play these to set-mine (try to hit three of a kind on the flop).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hands You Should Usually Fold</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Weak aces:</strong> A7o, A6o, A5o from early and middle position. These hands hit top pair with a bad kicker and lose to better aces.</li>
  <li><strong>Unconnected, unsuited low cards:</strong> J4o, T3o, 92o. These are pure trash. Fold immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>King-rag:</strong> K5o, K3o, K2o. Hitting a king with a weak kicker costs you money against better kings.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-title">The 20/80 Rule</div>
  <p>As a beginner, you should be voluntarily putting money in the pot about 18-22% of the time in a 6-max game. This means folding roughly 4 out of every 5 hands dealt to you. It feels boring. It feels like you are missing out. But tight play from the right positions is the foundation of profitable poker.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="position">Understanding Position</h2>

  <p>Position is the single most important concept in poker, and understanding it will immediately make you a better player. Position refers to where you sit at the table relative to the dealer button. The player on the button acts last on every street after the flop, which is a massive advantage.</p>

  <h3>Why Acting Last Matters</h3>
  <p>When you act last, you have more information than everyone else at the table. You see whether your opponents checked (usually weak), bet small (sometimes weak), or bet large (usually strong) before you make your decision. This information advantage lets you:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Bet for value more accurately</strong> because you know your opponents are likely weak when they check to you.</li>
  <li><strong>Bluff more effectively</strong> because you can take the betting lead when opponents show weakness.</li>
  <li><strong>Control the pot size.</strong> Check back with medium-strength hands to keep the pot small, or bet to build it when you are strong.</li>
  <li><strong>See free cards.</strong> If you have a draw, you can check behind and see the next card without putting more money in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Position Names at a 6-Max Table</h3>
  <table>
  <thead><tr><th>Position</th><th>Abbreviation</th><th>How Many Hands to Play</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>Under the Gun</td><td>UTG</td><td>Tightest. ~15% of hands.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hijack</td><td>HJ</td><td>Slightly wider. ~18% of hands.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cutoff</td><td>CO</td><td>Open up. ~25% of hands.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Button</td><td>BTN</td><td>Widest. ~35-40% of hands.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Small Blind</td><td>SB</td><td>Tough spot. Raise or fold ~40-50% when folded to.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Big Blind</td><td>BB</td><td>Defend a wide range because you already have money in.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Notice how the number of hands you play increases as you get closer to the button. This is not a coincidence. Position is so valuable that you can profitably play hands from the button that would be losing plays from under the gun.</p>

  <h2 id="preflop">Preflop Strategy</h2>

  <h3>When No One Has Raised</h3>
  <p>If the action folds to you and no one has entered the pot, you have two options: raise or fold. At the micro stakes, limping (just calling the big blind) is almost always wrong. When you raise, you take the initiative. You put pressure on the blinds and represent a strong hand. When you limp, you invite multiple players into the pot and give up the initiative.</p>

  <p><strong>Standard open-raise size in 2026:</strong> 2.5 to 3 times the big blind. At a $0.05/$0.10 table, this means raising to $0.25-$0.30. Add one big blind for each limper already in the pot.</p>

  <h3>When Someone Has Already Raised</h3>
  <p>When facing a raise, your options are call, re-raise (3-bet), or fold. As a beginner, here is a simplified framework:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>3-bet (re-raise) with:</strong> AA, KK, QQ, AKs, AKo. These are strong enough to build a big pot preflop.</li>
  <li><strong>Call with:</strong> JJ, TT, 99, AQs, AQo, suited connectors in position, small pairs for set-mining.</li>
  <li><strong>Fold everything else.</strong> Yes, that means folding KJo, QTo, and other hands that look decent but play poorly against a range that is raising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When You Are in the Blinds</h3>
  <p>Playing from the blinds is the trickiest part of preflop strategy because you are out of position for the rest of the hand. In the big blind, you have already invested money and are getting a discount to see the flop, so you can defend a wider range. In the small blind, you are out of position against everyone and should play tighter.</p>

  <h2 id="postflop">Postflop Fundamentals</h2>

  <p>Postflop is where the complex decisions happen. Here are the fundamental concepts every beginner needs:</p>

  <h3>Continuation Betting (C-Betting)</h3>
  <p>When you raised preflop and the flop comes, you should often bet again regardless of whether you hit the board. This is called a continuation bet or c-bet. It works because the preflop raiser is assumed to have a stronger range than the caller, and most flops miss most hands. A c-bet size of one-third to one-half the pot works well on most boards.</p>

  <h3>When Not to C-Bet</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Wet, connected boards</strong> like 8-9-T or J-Q-K when you have nothing. These boards hit calling ranges hard.</li>
  <li><strong>Against multiple opponents.</strong> The more players in the pot, the less likely a bluff succeeds.</li>
  <li><strong>When you have a decent hand but not a great one.</strong> Sometimes checking back with middle pair to control the pot size is the right play.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pot Odds and Implied Odds</h3>
  <p>Pot odds are the ratio of the current pot size to the cost of calling a bet. If the pot is $10 and your opponent bets $5, you need to call $5 to win a total pot of $15. That is 3:1 pot odds, meaning you need to win the hand at least 25% of the time for the call to be profitable.</p>

  <p>If you have a flush draw (approximately 35% to hit by the river with two cards to come), and you are getting 3:1 pot odds, calling is profitable because 35% is greater than the 25% you need.</p>

  <p>This basic math is the foundation of every good poker decision. You do not need to calculate exact percentages in real time, but understanding the concept will improve your decisions dramatically.

  <h2 id="betting">Bet Sizing for Beginners</h2>

  <p>One of the most common beginner leaks is inconsistent or incorrect bet sizing. Here are simple guidelines:</p>

  <table>
  <thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Recommended Size</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>Preflop open-raise</td><td>2.5-3x big blind</td><td>Standard raise to narrow the field</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C-bet on dry flop</td><td>25-33% pot</td><td>Small bet works on boards that favor you</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C-bet on wet flop</td><td>50-66% pot</td><td>Bigger to charge draws and protect your hand</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Value bet turn/river</td><td>50-75% pot</td><td>Extract maximum from worse hands</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bluff on river</td><td>66-100% pot</td><td>Larger to maximize fold equity</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-title">Consistency Matters</div>
  <p>Use the same bet sizes with your strong hands and your bluffs. If you always bet big with strong hands and small with bluffs, observant opponents will pick up on the pattern and exploit you. Consistent sizing keeps your opponents guessing.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="bluffing">Bluffing Basics</h2>

  <p>Bluffing is the most glamorous and most misunderstood part of poker. Beginners tend to either bluff too much (because it looks cool) or never bluff (because they are scared of getting caught). Neither extreme is correct.</p>

  <h3>When to Bluff</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Against one opponent, not multiple.</strong> Bluffing into three players almost never works because someone usually has something.</li>
  <li><strong>When you have a draw.</strong> Betting with a flush draw or straight draw is called a semi-bluff. Even if your opponent calls, you can still win by hitting your draw. This is the safest type of bluff.</li>
  <li><strong>When the board favors your range.</strong> If you raised from under the gun and the flop comes A-K-Q, your perceived range includes lots of strong hands. Bluffing on boards that align with your story is more convincing.</li>
  <li><strong>When your opponent shows weakness.</strong> If they checked twice, they usually have a weak hand. A well-timed bet can take the pot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When Not to Bluff</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Against players who call everything.</strong> At micro stakes, many players are calling stations. They call with any pair, any draw, and sometimes with nothing at all. You cannot bluff someone who never folds.</li>
  <li><strong>On a board that clearly hits the caller's range.</strong> If you raised and the flop comes 7-8-9, your caller probably has connected hands. Bluffing into a range that hit the board is burning money.</li>
  <li><strong>When you have no story.</strong> A bluff needs to tell a consistent story across streets. If your actions on the flop, turn, and river do not make sense for a strong hand, good opponents will see through it.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>At the micro stakes, your money comes from value betting strong hands against players who call too much. Bluffing is a secondary strategy, not your primary weapon.</blockquote>

  <h2 id="bankroll">Bankroll Management</h2>

  <p>Your bankroll is the total amount of money you have set aside specifically for playing poker. It is separate from your rent money, your savings, and your daily expenses. Proper bankroll management is what prevents a bad run of cards from ending your poker career.</p>

  <h3>Recommended Bankrolls for Beginners</h3>
  <table>
  <thead><tr><th>Stakes</th><th>Buy-In</th><th>Min Bankroll (20 BI)</th><th>Comfortable Bankroll (30 BI)</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>$0.01/$0.02</td><td>$2</td><td>$40</td><td>$60</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$0.02/$0.05</td><td>$5</td><td>$100</td><td>$150</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$0.05/$0.10</td><td>$10</td><td>$200</td><td>$300</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$0.10/$0.25</td><td>$25</td><td>$500</td><td>$750</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><strong>Move down if your bankroll drops below 15 buy-ins.</strong> There is no shame in dropping stakes. Even professional players move down during downswings. Moving down protects your bankroll and lets you rebuild with less pressure.</p>

  <p><strong>Move up when you have 30+ buy-ins for the next level AND you are a consistent winner at your current level.</strong> Moving up prematurely is the fastest way to destroy a bankroll.</p>

  <h2 id="reads">Reading Your Opponents Online</h2>

  <p>You cannot see facial expressions online, but there are still plenty of reliable tells:</p>

  <h3>Timing Tells</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Instant check:</strong> They used the auto-check button, which means they decided to give up before action reached them. Usually very weak.</li>
  <li><strong>Instant call:</strong> Usually a draw. They already decided to call and did not need to think about it.</li>
  <li><strong>Long pause then bet:</strong> Often strength. They are pretending to think with a hand they know is strong.</li>
  <li><strong>Long pause then check:</strong> Could be genuine indecision. Often a marginal hand debating whether to bet.</li>

  <h3>Sizing Tells</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Minimum bet:</strong> Frequently weakness. Recreational players often min-bet with marginal hands.</li>
  <li><strong>Overbet (larger than the pot):</strong> Polarized. Either a monster hand or a bluff. Rarely something in between.</li>
  <li><strong>Odd amounts ($7.77 into a $10 pot):</strong> Usually a recreational player who is not thinking about sizing theory. Often indicates strength.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
  <p>Pay attention to how opponents play over multiple hands. Do they always fold to a river bet? Do they always call with draws? Do they only raise with premium hands? After 20-30 hands, you can start identifying patterns and adjusting your strategy accordingly.</p>

  <h2 id="mistakes">10 Mistakes Every Beginner Makes</h2>

  <ol>
  <li><strong>Playing too many hands.</strong> Fold more. Seriously. If you are playing more than 25% of hands at a 6-max table, you are playing too loose.</li>
  <li><strong>Calling too much, raising too little.</strong> Calling is passive. Raising is aggressive. Aggressive play wins poker. When you have a good hand, raise. When you are unsure, fold. Calling should be the least common action in your game.</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring position.</strong> Playing K-J from under the gun and K-J from the button should be completely different decisions. Position changes everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Chasing draws without pot odds.</strong> Just because you have four cards to a flush does not mean you should call any bet. Calculate whether the pot odds justify the call.</li>
  <li><strong>Playing above your bankroll.</strong> If you are playing $0.25/$0.50 with a $100 bankroll, one bad session can wipe you out. Play stakes appropriate to your bankroll.</li>
  <li><strong>Tilting after bad beats.</strong> Bad beats are mathematically guaranteed. If you cannot handle losing when you were ahead, poker will destroy your bankroll and your mental health. Take a break after a bad beat. Come back when you can think clearly.</li>
  <li><strong>Not paying attention.</strong> Every hand provides information, even hands you are not in. Watch how opponents play and build a mental picture of their tendencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Overvaluing top pair.</strong> Top pair with a weak kicker is not a strong hand. When someone raises your bet on the turn and you have A-5 on an A-K-8-3 board, they almost certainly have you beat.</li>
  <li><strong>Playing tired, drunk, or distracted.</strong> Poker requires mental sharpness. Playing when your mind is not fully engaged is a guaranteed way to lose money.</li>
  <li><strong>Never studying.</strong> Playing poker without studying is like going to the gym and never changing your routine. You plateau quickly. Spend at least 30 minutes studying for every hour you play.</li>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>What is the best poker strategy for beginners?</h3>
  <p>Play tight-aggressive (TAG). Play fewer hands than your opponents and bet/raise instead of calling when you enter a pot. At micro stakes, simply playing strong starting hands in good positions and value betting when you have the best hand will put you ahead of most opponents.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>How many hands should a beginner play in poker?</h3>
  <p>About 15-20% of hands in a full-ring (9 player) game and 20-25% in a 6-max game. This means folding the majority of hands preflop. Focus on premium pairs, strong aces, and suited connectors in late position.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>What is position in poker and why does it matter?</h3>
  <p>Position is where you sit relative to the dealer button. Acting last (being in position) gives you a massive information advantage because you see what opponents do before you decide. The button is the most profitable seat. Play more hands in late position, fewer in early position.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>How much money do I need to start playing online poker?</h3>
  <p>You can start with $20-50 at the lowest stakes. A proper bankroll for micro stakes cash games is 20-30 buy-ins, which means $40-60 for 1c/2c games. Many sites also offer freeroll tournaments where you can win real money with no entry fee.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>Should beginners play cash games or tournaments?</h3>
  <p>Cash games are better for beginners because the blinds stay constant, you can leave anytime, and you focus on fundamental strategy. Tournaments require additional knowledge of changing blind structures and ICM. Start with cash games, then try tournaments once you are comfortable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
  <h3>How long does it take to get good at poker?</h3>
  <p>Most dedicated players can beat micro stakes games within 3-6 months of serious study and practice. Becoming a consistent winner at low stakes typically takes 1-2 years. The most important factor is studying away from the table, not just playing hands.</p>
