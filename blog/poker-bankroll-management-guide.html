<h1>Poker Bankroll Management: Complete Guide</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 28, 2026 &bull; 16 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.poker/">MonkeyPoker</a></p>

<p>Bankroll management is the most important skill in poker that has nothing to do with how you play your cards. You can be the most skilled player at your table and still go broke if you play at stakes that are too high for your bankroll. Conversely, a moderately skilled player with disciplined bankroll management will almost never go broke and will steadily climb to higher stakes as their skills and bankroll grow.</p>

<p>The mathematics are unforgiving. Even a player with a significant edge will experience losing streaks of 20, 30, or even 50 buy-ins. These downswings are not anomalies. They are statistical certainties over a large enough sample. The only question is whether your bankroll can absorb them without forcing you to drop stakes, take shots you cannot afford, or worse, redeposit money you cannot afford to lose.</p>

<p>This guide covers the precise bankroll requirements for every format of poker, from micro-stakes online cash games to live tournament circuits, and provides a framework for when to move up, when to move down, and how to protect your bankroll from the emotional decisions that destroy most poker careers.</p>

<h2 id="why">1. Why Bankroll Management Matters</h2>

<p>Poker is a game of small edges applied over large samples. A winning player at $1/$2 No-Limit Hold'em might earn 5-10 big blinds per 100 hands in the long run. That is $10-$20 per 100 hands, which sounds profitable until you understand the variance involved. That same winning player will regularly experience stretches of 5,000-10,000 hands where they lose money despite playing well.</p>

<p>A player who sits down at $1/$2 with a $400 bankroll (two buy-ins) will go broke roughly 80% of the time even if they are a winning player. The variance will eat their bankroll before their edge has time to manifest. A player with the exact same skill but a $6,000 bankroll (30 buy-ins) at the same stakes will almost never go broke. The additional capital buys time for their edge to overcome short-term variance.</p>

<p>Bankroll management is not about being cautious or scared money. It is about ensuring that the mathematical edge you have at the poker table translates into actual profit over time rather than being wiped out by normal statistical fluctuations.</p>

<h2 id="cash-games">2. Cash Game Bankroll Requirements</h2>

<p>Cash game bankroll requirements depend on your format (full ring vs 6-max), your platform (online vs live), and your win rate. Here are the standard guidelines used by professional players and serious amateurs in 2026:</p>

<h3>Online Cash Games</h3>
<p><strong>Conservative (recommended for most players):</strong> 30 buy-ins. For $0.05/$0.10 NL Hold'em with a $10 max buy-in, you need a $300 bankroll. For $0.25/$0.50 with a $50 buy-in, you need $1,500. For $1/$2 with a $200 buy-in, you need $6,000.</p>

<p><strong>Aggressive (for experienced players with proven win rates):</strong> 20 buy-ins. This reduces the required bankroll by a third but increases your risk of ruin from approximately 1% to 5%. Only appropriate if you have at least 50,000 hands of data showing a positive win rate at your current stakes.</p>

<p><strong>Professional (for full-time players):</strong> 50 buy-ins. Professionals need extra cushion because their bankroll is their livelihood. A recreational player who goes broke can reload from their day job. A professional who goes broke has no income. The extra 20 buy-ins provide margin for downswings, living expenses, and the psychological comfort needed to play your best.</p>

<h3>Live Cash Games</h3>
<p><strong>Standard recommendation:</strong> 20 buy-ins. Live games run significantly softer than online games at equivalent stakes. A competent player's win rate in a typical $1/$2 live game is 8-15 big blinds per hour, roughly double or triple the win rate achievable online at the same stakes. The higher win rate reduces variance relative to your bankroll, making 20 buy-ins sufficient for most live players.</p>

<p>For $1/$2 NL with a $300 max buy-in, that means a $6,000 bankroll. For $2/$5 with a $500 buy-in, $10,000. For $5/$10, $20,000-$30,000 depending on buy-in size and game softness.</p>

<h2 id="tournaments">3. Tournament Bankroll Requirements</h2>

<p>Tournaments have far higher variance than cash games. Even the best tournament players in the world have return on investment (ROI) figures of 30-100% in smaller fields and 10-30% in larger fields. This means a player with a 50% ROI who enters a $100 tournament expects to earn $50 in profit per tournament on average, but the standard deviation is enormous.</p>

<p>In any given tournament, you have a roughly 85-90% chance of finishing out of the money. A tournament player can easily go 50-100 tournaments without a significant cash. This extreme variance requires a much larger bankroll relative to buy-in size.</p>

<p><strong>Online multi-table tournaments (MTTs):</strong> 100-200 buy-ins. For a player who primarily enters $10 online MTTs, a $1,000-$2,000 bankroll. For $50 MTTs, $5,000-$10,000. The wide range accounts for field size. Larger field tournaments (1,000+ entries) require more buy-ins due to higher variance, while smaller field events (100-300 entries) can be played with fewer.</p>

<p><strong>Live tournaments:</strong> 50-100 buy-ins. Live tournament fields are typically smaller (50-500 entries) and softer than online equivalents, reducing variance. For a player grinding $200 live dailies, a $10,000-$20,000 bankroll. For $500 tournament buy-ins, $25,000-$50,000. For $1,000+ buy-ins, you should be a proven tournament player with extensive experience before considering these stakes.</p>

<h2 id="sit-and-go">4. Sit-and-Go Bankroll Guidelines</h2>

<p>Sit-and-gos (SNGs) fall between cash games and MTTs in terms of variance. Standard 9-player SNGs have lower variance than MTTs because the field is fixed and small, but higher variance than cash games because of the winner-take-most payout structure.</p>

<p><strong>Standard 9-player SNGs:</strong> 40-60 buy-ins. A player grinding $5 SNGs needs a $200-$300 bankroll. For $20 SNGs, $800-$1,200. For $50 SNGs, $2,000-$3,000.</p>

<p><strong>Turbo and hyper-turbo SNGs:</strong> 60-80 buy-ins. Faster blind structures increase variance by reducing the number of decisions per tournament, making individual results more luck-dependent.</p>

<p><strong>Heads-up SNGs:</strong> 40-50 buy-ins. Despite having only two players, heads-up SNGs have relatively high variance because every match is a coin flip plus a small edge. Experienced heads-up players with strong win rates can play on 30 buy-ins.</p>

<h2 id="moving-up">5. When to Move Up in Stakes</h2>

<p>Moving up in stakes is the most exciting and most dangerous moment in a poker career. The common mistake is moving up too soon, before your bankroll or your skills justify the higher stakes.</p>

<p><strong>The bankroll threshold:</strong> You should have the full recommended number of buy-ins for the next stake before moving up. If you play $0.25/$0.50 online and want to move to $0.50/$1.00, you need 30 buy-ins at the new level ($3,000 for $100 buy-ins) before making the jump. Do not move up the moment you can afford 10 buy-ins at the next level.</p>

<p><strong>The skill threshold:</strong> Bankroll alone is not sufficient. You should have a documented winning record at your current stakes over at least 30,000-50,000 hands online or 300-500 hours live. If you are break-even or losing at your current stakes, moving up will not solve the problem. The games get harder, not easier, as you climb.</p>

<p><strong>The shot-taking approach:</strong> A disciplined way to test higher stakes is to take a "shot" with a fixed number of buy-ins. Allocate 5-10 buy-ins from your bankroll specifically for the higher stakes. If you lose them all, drop back down without emotional attachment. If you run well and build to a full bankroll for the higher stakes, stay. This approach limits your downside while giving you the opportunity to move up.</p>

<h2 id="moving-down">6. When to Move Down in Stakes</h2>

<p>Moving down in stakes is emotionally difficult but financially essential. Your drop-down trigger should be predetermined and non-negotiable.</p>

<p><strong>Standard rule:</strong> If your bankroll drops below 20 buy-ins for your current stakes, move down immediately. No exceptions, no "one more session to try to win it back." At 20 buy-ins, your risk of ruin is increasing rapidly, and every session you play at that level without a cushion threatens your entire bankroll.</p>

<p><strong>Rebuilding:</strong> Once you drop down, treat the lower stakes as your current level. Do not think of it as temporary. Play to win, rebuild your bankroll to the full threshold for moving back up, and then reassess whether you are ready to move up again both in terms of bankroll and skill.</p>

<p>The willingness to move down is what separates long-term winning players from those who go broke repeatedly. Every successful professional poker player has moved down in stakes multiple times during their career. It is not a sign of failure. It is a sign of discipline.</p>

<h2 id="variance">7. Understanding Variance in Poker</h2>

<p>Variance is the statistical measure of how much your actual results deviate from your expected results. In poker, variance is extremely high because the outcome of individual hands is heavily influenced by luck, while skill only manifests over large samples.</p>

<p>To illustrate: a winning $1/$2 player with a win rate of 8 big blinds per 100 hands ($16/100 hands) will have a standard deviation of approximately 80-100 big blinds per 100 hands. This means that over any given 100-hand sample, their results will typically fall between losing $184 and winning $216. The expected profit of $16 is dwarfed by the natural fluctuation of $200 in either direction.</p>

<p>Over 10,000 hands, the same player expects to win $1,600 but could easily be anywhere from down $2,400 to up $5,600. Over 100,000 hands, variance tightens and the player expects to be profitable 95%+ of the time. This is why sample size matters enormously and why bankroll management exists: to keep you in action long enough for your edge to overcome the noise.</p>

<h2 id="online-vs-live">8. Online vs Live Bankroll Differences</h2>

<p>Online and live poker have fundamentally different variance profiles. Online games deal 60-100 hands per hour per table, and most players multi-table 2-8 tables simultaneously. Live games deal 25-35 hands per hour at a single table.</p>

<p>The faster pace of online poker means you experience downswings more quickly and more frequently. A 10-buy-in downswing that takes weeks to develop in live play can happen in a single day of online multi-tabling. This psychological compression makes larger bankrolls more important online, even though the mathematical variance per hand is similar.</p>

<p>Live games also tend to be significantly softer than online games at equivalent stakes. A winning player's edge in a $1/$2 live game is typically 2-3x larger than in an equivalent online game. This higher edge reduces the bankroll requirement because downswings are shorter and less severe relative to expected win rate.</p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes">9. Common Bankroll Management Mistakes</h2>

<h3>Playing Above Your Bankroll</h3>
<p>The most common mistake. A player with a $2,000 bankroll who plays $1/$2 (6-7 buy-ins) is not properly bankrolled. One bad session can wipe out a third of their entire roll, creating psychological pressure that degrades decision-making and leads to further losses.</p>

<h3>Not Counting Living Expenses</h3>
<p>For full-time players, your poker bankroll must be completely separate from your living expenses. If your bankroll is $10,000 but you need $3,000 of that for rent and bills next month, your actual poker bankroll is $7,000. Many aspiring pros have gone broke by counting money they needed for life expenses as part of their playing bankroll.</p>

<h3>Moving Up After a Heater</h3>
<p>Winning a big session or running above expectation for a week does not mean you should immediately jump to higher stakes. Your bankroll threshold should be based on sustained performance, not a single hot streak. Many players move up during a heater, immediately face higher-quality opposition and normal variance, and lose back their recent gains at a stake they cannot afford.</p>

<h3>Refusing to Move Down</h3>
<p>Ego is the bankroll killer. Players who view moving down as shameful will play through their bankroll at stakes they can no longer afford rather than taking the disciplined step backward. Every session played below your minimum bankroll threshold increases your risk of going broke.</p>

<h2 id="tracking">10. Tracking Your Bankroll</h2>

<p>You cannot manage what you do not measure. Every serious poker player should track every session including the date, game type, stakes, duration, and profit or loss. Free tools like PokerTracker 4, Hold'em Manager 3, and even a simple spreadsheet provide the data you need to make informed bankroll decisions.</p>

<p>Key metrics to track include your overall win rate (in big blinds per 100 hands for cash games or ROI percentage for tournaments), your biggest downswing (in buy-ins), your session-by-session results, and your bankroll trend over time. This data tells you whether you are a winning player at your current stakes and whether your bankroll management rules are working.</p>

<p>Review your bankroll data monthly. If you are consistently winning, check whether you are approaching the threshold to move up. If you are on a downswing, verify that you are still above your minimum bankroll requirement. If you are consistently losing over a large sample (50,000+ hands or 200+ tournaments), the issue is your play, not your bankroll management, and you need to invest in study and coaching before continuing.</p>

<div class="faq" id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<details>
<summary>How many buy-ins do you need for poker?</summary>
<p>For online cash games, 30 buy-ins is the standard recommendation. For live cash games, 20 buy-ins. For online tournaments, 100-200 buy-ins. For sit-and-gos, 40-60 buy-ins. Professional players should add 50-100% more on top of these numbers for additional security. The exact number depends on your win rate, the game's variance, and whether poker is your sole income.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should you move up in poker stakes?</summary>
<p>Move up when you have the full recommended number of buy-ins for the next stake AND a documented winning record at your current stakes over 30,000+ hands online or 300+ hours live. Having the bankroll but not the winning track record means you need more study, not higher stakes. A shot-taking approach with 5-10 buy-ins allocated for the higher stake is a disciplined way to test the move.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a good bankroll for $1/$2 No-Limit Hold'em?</summary>
<p>For live $1/$2 with a typical $300 max buy-in, a bankroll of $6,000 (20 buy-ins) is standard. For online $1/$2 with a $200 max buy-in, $6,000 (30 buy-ins) is recommended. Professional players who depend on poker income should have $10,000-$15,000 for live or online $1/$2 to provide additional security against extended downswings.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you recover from a poker downswing?</summary>
<p>First, verify you are still within your bankroll requirements. If you have dropped below the minimum, move down in stakes immediately. Second, review your recent play for leaks by studying hand histories. Third, take a break if the downswing is affecting your emotional state. Fourth, return to the table at appropriate stakes and trust the process. Downswings are mathematically inevitable and do not indicate you are playing poorly.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Should your poker bankroll be separate from personal savings?</summary>
<p>Absolutely. Your poker bankroll should be completely separate from your personal finances. Never play poker with money you need for rent, bills, or other essential expenses. For recreational players, your bankroll should be money you can afford to lose entirely. For professionals, the bankroll is a business asset that should have its own bank account, completely isolated from living expenses and emergency savings.</p>
