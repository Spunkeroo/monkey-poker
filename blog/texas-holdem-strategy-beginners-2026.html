<h2 id="basics">1. The Basics in 60 Seconds</h2>

<p>Every player gets two private cards (hole cards). Five community cards are dealt face up on the board in three stages: the flop (3 cards), the turn (1 card), and the river (1 card). You make the best 5-card hand using any combination of your 2 hole cards and the 5 community cards. There are four rounds of betting: pre-flop, flop, turn, and river. The best hand at showdown wins the pot, or the last player remaining wins if everyone else folds.</p>

<p>Two players post forced bets (the small blind and big blind) before each hand to create action. The dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, and so do the blinds. That is the entire structure. Now let us talk about how to actually win.</p>

<h2 id="starting-hands">2. Starting Hand Selection: The Foundation</h2>

<p>The single most impactful change a beginner can make is playing fewer hands. Most beginners play 40% to 60% of the hands they are dealt. Winning players at low stakes typically play 15% to 25%. The discipline to fold mediocre hands is the foundation of profitable poker.</p>

<h3>Tier 1: Premium Hands (Always Play)</h3>
<p>These hands are strong enough to play from any position at the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pocket Aces (AA).</strong> The best starting hand in Hold'em. Raise or re-raise before the flop every time. You are roughly an 85% favorite against any single random hand.</li>
<li><strong>Pocket Kings (KK).</strong> The second best starting hand. Play it the same as aces. The only hand that dominates you pre-flop is AA, and that is rare.</li>
<li><strong>Pocket Queens (QQ).</strong> Still a monster. Raise pre-flop. Be cautious if an ace or king hits the flop, especially against multiple opponents.</li>
<li><strong>Ace-King suited (AKs).</strong> The best non-pair starting hand. Strong drawing potential and top pair when it connects. The suited version adds flush possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tier 2: Strong Hands (Play in Most Positions)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pocket Jacks (JJ), Pocket Tens (TT).</strong> Strong hands that require more post-flop skill. Raise pre-flop but be prepared to slow down if overcards hit the board.</li>
<li><strong>Ace-Queen suited (AQs), Ace-King offsuit (AKo).</strong> Strong hands that make top pair with a good kicker. Raise pre-flop from any position.</li>
<li><strong>King-Queen suited (KQs).</strong> A strong drawing hand with straight and flush potential. Best played from middle to late position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tier 3: Playable Hands (Position Dependent)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium pairs (99, 88, 77).</strong> Play these to set mine (hoping to hit three of a kind on the flop). If you do not hit a set, proceed cautiously.</li>
<li><strong>Suited connectors (JTs, T9s, 98s).</strong> These make straights and flushes. Play them in position when you can see a cheap flop.</li>
<li><strong>Ace-suited hands (A5s, A4s, A3s, A2s).</strong> Nut flush potential makes these playable from late position. Weak as top pair hands.</li>
<li><strong>Suited face cards (KJs, QJs, KTs).</strong> Decent drawing hands from middle to late position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hands to Fold</h3>
<p>Everything else. Seriously. K7 offsuit, Q4 suited, J3, random small cards. These hands look tempting but they lose money over time. The biggest leak in beginner poker is playing too many starting hands. Every time you fold a bad hand, you save money that you would have lost playing it.</p>

<h2 id="position">3. Position: The Most Underrated Advantage</h2>

<p>Position is the most powerful concept in poker and the one beginners understand least. Your position at the table determines when you act relative to other players. Acting later is a massive advantage because you get to see what everyone else does before making your decision.</p>

<h3>The Positions</h3>
<p><strong>Early position (EP):</strong> The seats immediately left of the big blind. You act first after the flop. Play only premium and strong hands from here because you have no information about what other players will do.</p>

<p><strong>Middle position (MP):</strong> The seats between early and late position. You can widen your range slightly because fewer players act after you.</p>

<p><strong>Late position (LP):</strong> The cutoff (one seat before the dealer) and the button (the dealer position). These are the most profitable seats at the table. You act last on every post-flop street, which means you see what everyone else does before you make a decision. You can play more hands from here, bluff more effectively, and control the size of the pot.</p>

<p><strong>The blinds:</strong> The small blind and big blind act last pre-flop but first on every subsequent street. This is the worst position at the table. You are forced to put money in with random cards and then play out of position for the rest of the hand. Defend your blinds selectively, not reflexively.</p>

<h3>Why Position Matters</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a medium-strength hand on the river. In early position, you have to guess whether to bet, check, or fold without knowing what your opponent will do. In late position, if your opponent checks, you can bet for thin value or check behind for a free showdown. If your opponent bets, you can fold your medium hand without losing extra chips. This informational advantage plays out on every street of every hand and adds up to a massive edge over hundreds of hands.</p>

<p><strong>The rule of thumb:</strong> Play tight in early position. Play looser in late position. The button is the most profitable seat at the table. Over time, you should be playing 2 to 3 times more hands from the button than from under the gun.</p>

<h2 id="pot-odds">4. Pot Odds: The Math That Pays</h2>

<p>Pot odds tell you whether calling a bet is mathematically profitable based on the size of the pot versus the cost of the call. You do not need to be a math genius. You just need to understand the basic concept.</p>

<h3>How Pot Odds Work</h3>
<p>The pot has $100 in it. Your opponent bets $50. Now the pot is $150 and it costs you $50 to call. Your pot odds are 150:50, which simplifies to 3:1. This means you need to win this hand more than 1 out of every 4 times (25%) for the call to be profitable.</p>

<p>If you have a flush draw (9 outs, roughly 19% chance to hit on the next card), calling this bet is not immediately profitable. But if the implied odds (the additional money you expect to win when you do hit) are good enough, it can still be a profitable call.</p>

<h3>Common Drawing Odds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flush draw (9 outs):</strong> About 19% to hit on the next card, about 35% to hit by the river.</li>
<li><strong>Open-ended straight draw (8 outs):</strong> About 17% to hit on the next card, about 32% by the river.</li>
<li><strong>Gutshot straight draw (4 outs):</strong> About 9% on the next card, about 17% by the river.</li>
<li><strong>Two overcards (6 outs):</strong> About 13% on the next card, about 24% by the river.</li>
<li><strong>Set on the flop with a pocket pair (2 outs):</strong> About 12% to flop a set (calculated pre-flop).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Quick Math Shortcut</h3>
<p>The "Rule of 2 and 4" makes pot odds easy. Count your outs (the number of cards that complete your draw). On the flop with two cards to come, multiply your outs by 4 to get an approximate percentage. On the turn with one card to come, multiply your outs by 2. A flush draw with 9 outs on the flop: 9 x 4 = 36% (actual: 35%). On the turn: 9 x 2 = 18% (actual: 19.6%). Close enough for practical use.</p>

<h2 id="betting">5. Betting Strategy: Sizing and Timing</h2>

<h3>Pre-Flop Raise Sizing</h3>
<p>A standard pre-flop raise in 2026 is 2.5 to 3 times the big blind. If the big blind is $2, raise to $5 or $6. Add one big blind for each limper (player who just called the big blind) before you. If two players limped, raise to $7 or $8. Consistent sizing prevents giving away information about your hand strength.</p>

<h3>Post-Flop Bet Sizing</h3>
<p>Bet between 50% and 75% of the pot as your standard sizing. A pot of $20 calls for a bet of $10 to $15. Larger bets (75-100% pot) work well for value hands on wet boards (boards with many possible draws). Smaller bets (25-33% pot) work well on dry boards (boards with few draws) or when you want to bet frequently with a wide range.</p>

<h3>When to Bet</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For value.</strong> You have a strong hand and want weaker hands to call. This is the most important reason to bet.</li>
<li><strong>As a bluff.</strong> You have a weak hand and want stronger hands to fold. Effective bluffs tell a believable story.</li>
<li><strong>For protection.</strong> You have a vulnerable hand (like top pair on a draw-heavy board) and want to charge draws to continue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Check</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you have a medium-strength hand in position and want to control pot size.</li>
<li>When the board heavily favors your opponent's range.</li>
<li>When you want to trap with a very strong hand (check-raising).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bluffing">6. Bluffing: When and How</h2>

<p>Bluffing is the most exciting part of poker and the most misunderstood. Beginners either bluff too much (because it feels cool) or never bluff (because they are scared of getting caught). Good bluffing is neither random nor rare. It is calculated.</p>

<h3>When to Bluff</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When the board favors your perceived range.</strong> If you raised pre-flop and the board comes A-K-7, your opponents expect you to have strong hands. A continuation bet here works as a bluff even when you missed.</li>
<li><strong>When you have blockers.</strong> If you hold the Ace of hearts and three hearts are on the board, you block the nut flush. Your opponent is less likely to have the best possible hand, making your bluff more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Against one opponent, not three.</strong> Bluffs work best against one player. The more opponents in the pot, the more likely someone has a strong hand and will call.</li>
<li><strong>When you have equity.</strong> Semi-bluffs (bluffing with a draw that can improve) are more profitable than pure bluffs because you can win by making your hand even if called.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Not to Bluff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Against players who call everything. Some players at low stakes will call with any pair. Do not bluff these opponents. Value bet them relentlessly instead.</li>
<li>Into large pots with multiple players.</li>
<li>When your story does not make sense. Every bet tells a story. If your bluff does not represent a hand you would logically play this way, observant opponents will catch it.</li>
<li>When you are on tilt (playing emotionally after a bad beat). Emotional bluffs are expensive bluffs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bluffing Frequency</h3>
<p>At beginner and low-stakes levels, you should bluff less than you think. Most of your profit will come from value betting strong hands against opponents who call too much. As you move up in stakes and face better players, bluffing frequency needs to increase because better players fold more often.</p>

<h2 id="reading">7. Reading Other Players</h2>

<h3>Betting Patterns</h3>
<p>The most reliable "tell" in poker is not a facial expression or a hand tremor. It is betting patterns. Pay attention to how opponents bet in different situations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A player who always bets big with strong hands and small with weak hands</strong> is giving away free information. Adjust accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>A player who checks the flop and then bets the turn</strong> often has a drawing hand that either hit or is trying to buy a free card.</li>
<li><strong>A player who calls pre-flop, checks the flop, and then raises the turn</strong> frequently has a set or two pair that they slowplayed.</li>
<li><strong>A player who bets every flop but gives up on the turn when called</strong> is over-bluffing. Call more flops and see if they follow through.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Player Types</h3>
<p><strong>Tight-passive (the rock):</strong> Plays few hands and rarely raises. When they bet big, they have a monster. Fold your medium-strength hands against their aggression. Steal their blinds relentlessly.</p>

<p><strong>Loose-passive (the calling station):</strong> Plays too many hands and calls too often. Never bluff this player. Value bet your strong hands aggressively because they will pay you off with weak holdings.</p>

<p><strong>Tight-aggressive (TAG):</strong> Plays few hands but plays them aggressively. This is the style you should be learning. Respect their bets more than a loose player's bets.</p>

<p><strong>Loose-aggressive (LAG):</strong> Plays many hands and bets aggressively. These players are either very skilled or very wild. Against wild LAGs, tighten up and let them hang themselves by calling with strong hands.</p>

<h2 id="postflop">8. Post-Flop Play: Flop, Turn, and River</h2>

<h3>The Flop</h3>
<p>The flop is where you evaluate whether your hand connected with the board. Key questions to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I hit top pair or better? (Bet for value.)</li>
<li>Did I miss completely? (Consider a continuation bet if you were the pre-flop raiser. Give up if someone else bets.)</li>
<li>Do I have a draw? (Calculate your odds and decide if calling is profitable.)</li>
<li>Is the board wet (many possible draws) or dry (few draws)? Wet boards demand larger bets to charge draws. Dry boards allow smaller, more frequent bets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Turn</h3>
<p>The turn is where the pot gets serious. Bets are bigger and mistakes are costlier. If you were bluffing on the flop and got called, you need to decide whether to fire a second barrel or give up. If you were value betting, the turn is where you continue extracting chips from weaker hands. If you were drawing, reassess your odds with only one card to come.</p>

<p><strong>Key turn concept:</strong> The turn is where you narrow your opponent's range. A player who called your flop bet has a hand that was strong enough to continue. What hands are those? Top pair? A draw? A set? Your turn decision should be based on this narrowed range.</p>

<h3>The River</h3>
<p>The river is the final decision point. There are no more cards to come. Either your hand is strong enough to bet for value, or it is not. Either your bluff will work here, or it will not. River decisions are binary and they are the most consequential decisions in any hand.</p>

<p><strong>River value betting:</strong> Only bet if you believe your opponent will call with a worse hand more than 50% of the time. If they are only calling with hands that beat you, checking is better.</p>

<p><strong>River bluffing:</strong> Only bluff if you believe your opponent will fold a better hand more than the pot odds require. If the pot is $100 and you bet $50, your opponent is getting 3:1, so they need to fold more than 33% of the time for your bluff to profit.</p>

<h2 id="bankroll">9. Bankroll Management</h2>

<p>Bankroll management is the least exciting topic in poker and the one that determines whether you survive long enough to improve. Even the best players experience long losing streaks due to variance. Your bankroll needs to withstand these swings.</p>

<h3>The Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash games:</strong> Have at least 20 buy-ins for the stakes you play. For a $1/$2 game with a $200 maximum buy-in, you need a bankroll of at least $4,000.</li>
<li><strong>Tournaments:</strong> Have at least 50 buy-ins. Tournaments have higher variance than cash games because you can play perfectly and still bust early.</li>
<li><strong>Move down in stakes</strong> if your bankroll drops below 15 buy-ins. Protect your bankroll before your ego.</li>
<li><strong>Move up in stakes</strong> when your bankroll reaches 25+ buy-ins for the next level and you are consistently beating your current level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Never Play Scared Money</h3>
<p>If losing a buy-in would cause you financial stress, you are playing too high. Scared money plays poorly because you make decisions based on fear instead of strategy. Play at stakes where a bad session is a mild annoyance, not a financial crisis.</p>

<h2 id="mistakes">10. The 10 Most Expensive Beginner Mistakes</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Playing too many hands.</strong> The number one mistake. Fold more. A lot more. You should be folding 70% to 80% of your starting hands.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring position.</strong> Playing the same hands from every seat. Tighten up in early position, loosen up on the button.</li>
<li><strong>Calling too much, raising too little.</strong> Beginners call when they should raise and call when they should fold. Calling is the weakest action in poker. Raise or fold far more often than you call.</li>
<li><strong>Chasing draws without odds.</strong> Calling bets hoping to hit a straight or flush without calculating whether the pot odds justify the call.</li>
<li><strong>Playing above your bankroll.</strong> One bad session at too-high stakes can wipe out months of profit.</li>
<li><strong>Tilting after bad beats.</strong> Bad beats happen to everyone. The best players lose the hand and move on. The worst players lose the hand and then lose five more hands playing emotionally.</li>
<li><strong>Limping pre-flop.</strong> Just calling the big blind instead of raising is almost always a mistake. You build no pot, gain no information, and invite everyone behind you to play cheaply.</li>
<li><strong>Not adjusting to opponents.</strong> Playing the same strategy against every opponent. Bluffing calling stations. Trying to trap aggressive players who will bet for you.</li>
<li><strong>Betting the same amount regardless of hand strength.</strong> Your bet sizing should be consistent for your entire range in a given situation, not telegraphing whether you are strong or weak.</li>
<li><strong>Showdown hunting.</strong> Calling bets on every street just to "see if they are bluffing." If you do not have a strong hand or a strong draw, fold. Curiosity is expensive in poker.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="practice">11. Where to Practice for Free</h2>

<p>You do not need to risk real money to develop your skills. These platforms let you play Texas Hold'em for free:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PokerStars Play:</strong> The play-money version of the world's largest poker site. Large player pool, all game types, tournaments and cash games. Free chips daily.</li>
<li><strong>WSOP Free Poker:</strong> Official World Series of Poker free app. Play Hold'em and Omaha. Earn virtual bracelets and climb leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>888poker:</strong> Free play-money tables alongside real-money options. Solid interface and regular freeroll tournaments (real-money tournaments with no buy-in).</li>

<div class="faq" id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<details>
<summary>What is the best starting hand in Texas Hold'em?</summary>
<p>Pocket Aces (AA) is the best starting hand. You are approximately 85% to win against any single random hand pre-flop. Pocket Kings (KK) is second, and Pocket Queens (QQ) is third. Ace-King suited (AKs) is the strongest non-pair starting hand.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How many hands should I play as a beginner?</summary>
<p>Play around 15% to 20% of your starting hands. This means folding roughly 80% of the time pre-flop. This feels boring at first, but tight play is the foundation of winning poker. As you gain experience and improve your post-flop skills, you can gradually widen your range.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the most important poker skill for beginners?</summary>
<p>Starting hand selection and patience. The majority of beginner losses come from playing too many hands and calling too many bets with weak holdings. If you can master the discipline to fold bad hands consistently, you will immediately become a better player than most of your opponents at low stakes.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do pot odds work in simple terms?</summary>
<p>Pot odds compare how much you have to call versus how much is in the pot. If the pot is $100 and you have to call $25, your pot odds are 4:1 (you need to win more than 20% of the time for calling to be profitable). Compare this to your chance of hitting your draw. If your draw hits more often than the required percentage, calling is mathematically correct.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should I bluff as a beginner?</summary>
<p>Bluff sparingly at low stakes. Most of your profit will come from value betting strong hands. When you do bluff, target single opponents (not multiple players), choose boards that favor your perceived range, and use semi-bluffs (bluffing with a draw) rather than pure bluffs. Do not bluff players who call everything.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is position in poker and why does it matter?</summary>
<p>Position refers to where you sit relative to the dealer button and determines when you act on each betting round. Late position (the button and cutoff) is advantageous because you see what opponents do before making your decision. This allows you to make more informed choices, control pot size, and bluff more effectively. Professional players win the most money from late position.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much money do I need to start playing poker?</summary>
<p>For free practice, you need nothing. For real-money games, start with micro-stakes online ($0.01/$0.02 or $0.02/$0.05) where you can buy in for $2 to $5. A bankroll of $40 to $100 is enough to start at micro-stakes with proper bankroll management. Never play with money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is poker a game of skill or luck?</summary>
<p>Poker is a game of skill with short-term luck. In any single hand, the best player can lose to the worst player due to the cards. Over thousands of hands, the skilled player will consistently profit. This is why bankroll management matters: you need enough buy-ins to survive the short-term variance while your skill edge plays out over the long run.</p>
</details>
</div>

<h2>Start Playing, Keep Learning</h2>

<p>Texas Hold'em strategy is a rabbit hole that goes as deep as you want to take it. But every winning player started with these same fundamentals. Play tight starting hands, respect position, understand pot odds, bluff selectively, and manage your bankroll.</p>

<p>The best way to improve is to play, review your hands, and think about your decisions away from the table. Every session is a learning opportunity. Every bad beat is a chance to practice emotional control. Every hand you fold is money saved for when you have a real hand.</p>

<p>Start with free play-money games. Master the fundamentals. Then gradually move to real-money micro-stakes when you are consistently making good decisions. The poker journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Enjoy the learning process.</p>
