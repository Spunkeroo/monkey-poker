{"@type":"Question","name":"How do you play Texas Hold'em?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Each player receives two private cards (hole cards). Five community cards are dealt face-up in three stages: the flop (3 cards), the turn (1 card), and the river (1 card). Players make the best five-card hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards. Betting occurs before the flop and after each community card stage. The best hand at showdown wins the pot."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the hand rankings in Texas Hold'em?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"From highest to lowest: Royal Flush (A-K-Q-J-10 same suit), Straight Flush (five consecutive cards same suit), Four of a Kind, Full House (three of a kind plus a pair), Flush (five cards same suit), Straight (five consecutive cards), Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, High Card. Royal Flush is the rarest and most valuable hand."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the blinds in Texas Hold'em?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Blinds are forced bets posted by two players before cards are dealt to create action. The player left of the dealer posts the small blind (usually half the minimum bet) and the next player posts the big blind (the full minimum bet).

In Limit Hold'em, bets and raises are fixed at specific amounts: the small bet preflop and on the flop, and the big bet on the turn and river. No-Limit is more popular and creates bigger pots with more dramatic swings."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"How many players can play Texas Hold'em?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Texas Hold'em can be played with 2 to 10 players at a single table. The most common formats are 6-max (six players) and full ring (9-10 players). Heads-up (two players) is also popular. Online poker rooms typically offer all three formats. Home games commonly seat 6-9 players."}}

  <h2 id="objective">The Objective of Texas Hold'em</h2>

  <p>The objective is to win chips by either having the best five-card hand at showdown or by making all other players fold their hands. You do not need the best hand to win. If everyone else folds, you win the pot regardless of what cards you hold. This dual path to victory is what makes poker fundamentally different from other card games and what creates the strategic depth of bluffing, betting, and hand reading.</p>

  <p>Each player receives two private cards (called hole cards) that only they can see. Five community cards are dealt face-up in the center of the table that all players share. You make the best possible five-card hand using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards. You can use both of your hole cards, one of them, or neither (playing the board).</p>

  <h2 id="setup">Table Setup: Dealer, Blinds, and Positions</h2>

  <p>Before any cards are dealt, the table needs a dealer position and forced bets called blinds.</p>

  <h3>The Dealer Button</h3>
  <p>A round disc called the button indicates the dealer position. In casino and online poker, a professional dealer handles the cards, but the button rotates clockwise each hand to determine betting order. The player on the button acts last in every post-flop betting round, which is a significant strategic advantage.</p>

  <h3>The Blinds</h3>
  <p>Two players post forced bets before seeing their cards to create a pot worth fighting for. The player immediately left of the button posts the small blind, typically half the minimum bet. The next player posts the big blind, which equals the minimum bet. In a $1/$2 game, the small blind is $1 and the big blind is $2. Blinds rotate clockwise with the button so every player takes turns posting them.</p>

  <h3>Position Names</h3>
  <table>
  <thead><tr><th>Position</th><th>Abbreviation</th><th>Location</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td><strong>Under the Gun</strong></td><td>UTG</td><td>First to act preflop (left of big blind)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Middle Position</strong></td><td>MP</td><td>Between early and late position</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Hijack</strong></td><td>HJ</td><td>Two seats right of the button</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Cutoff</strong></td><td>CO</td><td>One seat right of the button</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Button</strong></td><td>BTN</td><td>Dealer position, acts last post-flop</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Small Blind</strong></td><td>SB</td><td>Left of button, posts small blind</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Big Blind</strong></td><td>BB</td><td>Left of SB, posts big blind</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2 id="rankings">Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest)</h2>

  <p>Memorize these hand rankings. They never change regardless of the poker variant. The highest-ranking hand wins at showdown.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><strong>Royal Flush:</strong> A, K, Q, J, 10 all of the same suit. The best possible hand in poker. Extremely rare.</li>
  <li><strong>Straight Flush:</strong> Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 7-8-9-10-J of hearts).</li>
  <li><strong>Four of a Kind:</strong> Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four Kings).</li>
  <li><strong>Full House:</strong> Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., three Jacks and two 8s). When two players have a full house, the higher three of a kind wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Flush:</strong> Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence (e.g., A-J-8-4-2 of spades). When two players have a flush, the highest card wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9). Ace can be high (A-K-Q-J-10) or low (A-2-3-4-5).</li>
  <li><strong>Three of a Kind:</strong> Three cards of the same rank (e.g., three Queens).</li>
  <li><strong>Two Pair:</strong> Two different pairs (e.g., two Aces and two 7s). The higher pair determines the winner between two players with two pair.</li>
  <li><strong>One Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank (e.g., two Kings). The pair plus the three highest remaining cards determine the winner.</li>
  <li><strong>High Card:</strong> When you have none of the above, your highest card plays. Ace is the highest card.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-title">Suit Rankings</div>
  <p>In Texas Hold'em, suits are all equal. A flush of hearts has the same value as a flush of spades. If two players have the same hand rank, the higher individual cards break the tie. If everything is identical, the pot is split.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="preflop">Preflop: The First Betting Round</h2>

  <p>After the blinds are posted, each player receives two hole cards face down. The first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big blind (Under the Gun). This player has three options:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Fold:</strong> Discard the hand and forfeit any chance at the pot.</li>
  <li><strong>Call:</strong> Match the big blind amount to stay in the hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Raise:</strong> Increase the bet. In No-Limit, the minimum raise is double the big blind, and the maximum is all of your chips.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Action continues clockwise around the table. Each player can fold, call the current bet, or raise. When action reaches the big blind, if no one has raised, the big blind can check (since they already have a bet in) or raise. Preflop betting ends when all remaining players have put in equal amounts.</p>

  <h2 id="flop">The Flop: Three Community Cards</h2>

  <p>The dealer burns one card (discards it face down) and deals three community cards face up in the center of the table. This is the flop. All remaining players can now use these three cards combined with their two hole cards to form a hand.</p>

  <p>Post-flop betting begins with the first active player to the left of the button. This player can check (bet nothing, pass the action) or bet. If someone bets, remaining players can fold, call, or raise. The round ends when all players have acted and all bets are equal.</p>

  <h2 id="turn">The Turn: Fourth Community Card</h2>

  <p>The dealer burns another card and deals one more community card face up. This is the turn (also called fourth street). There are now four community cards on the board. Another betting round occurs, following the same rules as the flop. In Limit Hold'em, the betting amount doubles on the turn.</p>

  <h2 id="river">The River: Fifth Community Card</h2>

  <p>The dealer burns a final card and deals the fifth and last community card face up. This is the river (also called fifth street). The board is now complete with five community cards. The final betting round occurs. After this round, if two or more players remain, the hand goes to showdown.</p>

  <h2 id="showdown">The Showdown</h2>

  <p>At showdown, remaining players reveal their hole cards. The player with the best five-card hand wins the pot. Players can use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to make their best hand. If the best five-card hand is the five community cards themselves (the board), any remaining players split the pot.</p>

  <p>In most poker rooms, the last player to bet or raise on the river shows first. If everyone checked the river, the player closest to the left of the button shows first. Players who cannot beat the shown hand can choose to muck (fold without showing) their cards.</p>

  <h2 id="betting">Betting Actions Explained</h2>

  <table>
  <thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>What It Means</th><th>When Available</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td><strong>Check</strong></td><td>Bet nothing, pass action to next player</td><td>When no bet has been made in the current round</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Bet</strong></td><td>Place the first wager in a betting round</td><td>When no one has bet yet in the current round</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Call</strong></td><td>Match the current bet amount</td><td>When someone has bet or raised</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Raise</strong></td><td>Increase the current bet</td><td>When someone has bet or raised</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Fold</strong></td><td>Discard your hand, forfeit the pot</td><td>At any point when it is your turn</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>All-In</strong></td><td>Bet all of your remaining chips</td><td>Any time you bet or call (No-Limit)</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2 id="formats">No-Limit vs Limit vs Pot-Limit</h2>

  <h3>No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE)</h3>
  <p>The most popular format. You can bet any amount from the minimum (the big blind) up to all of your chips at any time. The threat of losing your entire stack on a single hand creates enormous strategic depth. This is the format played in the World Series of Poker Main Event and most televised poker.</p>

  <h3>Limit Hold'em</h3>
  <p>Bets and raises are fixed at specific amounts. Preflop and on the flop, all bets and raises must equal the small bet (equal to the big blind). On the turn and river, all bets and raises must equal the big bet (double the small bet). There is usually a cap of three or four raises per betting round. Limit Hold'em is more mathematical and less dramatic than No-Limit.</p>

  <h3>Pot-Limit Hold'em (PLO-style betting)</h3>
  <p>The maximum bet is the current size of the pot. This creates a middle ground between the restricted betting of Limit and the unlimited betting of No-Limit. Pot-Limit betting is more commonly used in Omaha but some rooms offer Pot-Limit Hold'em.</p>

  <h2 id="etiquette">Poker Etiquette</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Act in turn.</strong> Wait for the action to reach you before making decisions. Acting out of turn gives information to other players and disrupts the game flow.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect your cards.</strong> Place a chip or card protector on your hole cards to prevent the dealer from accidentally mucking them.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not discuss live hands.</strong> Never comment on a hand in progress, even if you have folded. Saying "I would have had a straight" influences the remaining players' decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not slow roll.</strong> If you have the winning hand at showdown, reveal it promptly. Deliberately delaying the reveal to build false suspense is considered the worst breach of poker etiquette.</li>
  <li><strong>Announce your actions clearly.</strong> Say "raise" before placing chips to avoid ambiguity. A single chip placed forward without a verbal announcement is considered a call, not a raise.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip the dealer.</strong> In live casino poker, it is customary to tip the dealer after winning a pot. The standard is $1-2 for small pots and more for larger wins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="example">Full Hand Example</h2>

  <p>Let us walk through a complete hand at a $1/$2 No-Limit Hold'em table with six players:</p>

  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>Player A is on the button. Player B posts the $1 small blind. Player C posts the $2 big blind. Players D, E, and F are in early and middle position.</p>

  <h3>Preflop</h3>
  <p>Cards are dealt. Player D (UTG) looks at Queen-Jack suited and raises to $6. Player E folds. Player F folds. Player A (Button) has Ace-King offsuit and re-raises to $18. Player B (SB) folds. Player C (BB) folds. Player D calls the $18 (putting in $12 more). Pot: $39.</p>

  <h3>Flop</h3>
  <p>The dealer burns and deals: King of hearts, 7 of diamonds, 3 of clubs. Player D checks. Player A (who hit top pair top kicker with AK) bets $25. Player D calls. Pot: $89.</p>

  <h3>Turn</h3>
  <p>The dealer deals: 10 of spades. Player D checks. Player A bets $55. Player D (who now has a gutshot straight draw needing a 9 plus the Queen and Jack might be live) folds. Player A wins the $89 pot without showdown.</p>

  <p>This hand illustrates several key concepts: positional advantage (Player A acted last), aggressive play (raising and continuation betting), and the fold option (Player D correctly recognized they were behind and did not waste more chips chasing).</p>
